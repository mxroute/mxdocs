Sometimes customers will ask us what their DMARC record should be. This question actually arises from a misunderstanding of what DMARC is. The honest, quick answer is that there is no answer. Your DMARC record is a choice that you either make or don’t make, and what you set it to is entirely based on your preferences and needs. If you don’t know what you want a DMARC record to be, your default should be not to have one. If you do want one, you have no choice but to dive in deeper into what it is because simply offering one to paste in your DNS isn’t appropriate.
