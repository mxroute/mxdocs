# BRANDING INTRO

We have a few options available for branding / whitelabeling the service.

## Non-reseller service
For our regular, non-reseller customers, you can take two different paths to branding.

Custom mail/webmail subdomains on the server. The “mail” subdomain is for IMAP/SMTP/POP, the “webmail” subdomain is for Roundcube.  
Crossbox. This is a webmail product that we license, and you can brand it with the subdomain of your choice, as well as upload your own logo for the login page when visitors access it using your subdomain.

## Reseller Service
Custom mail/webmail/mailadmin subdomains on the server. The “mail” subdomain is for IMAP/SMTP/POP, the “webmail” subdomain is for Roundcube. The “mailadmin” subdomain is for DirectAdmin (since you’ll make DirectAdmin accounts for your customers).  
Crossbox. This is a webmail product that we license, and you can brand it with the subdomain of your choice, as well as upload your own logo for the login page when visitors access it using your subdomain.

## Note on Crossbox
Crossbox branding is not necessarily an alternate choice from the mail/webmail/mailadmin subdomains pointing to your primary server. However, they are two separate things. We recommend that you at least use the “mail” subdomain pointing to the primary mail server, and have “webmail” or any other subdomain you like point to Crossbox. Crossbox is a different product, sitting on a different server, that uses your primary mail server as it’s back-end.
