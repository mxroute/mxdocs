### Preface

Every now and then someone approaches us with something similar to “I have no technical knowledge and I need a perfect step by step process to change my email over to your service. Please no theory or rough guides that need to be interpreted based on our circumstances, but direct and step by step instructions.”

We tried to think of a comparable scenario to help explain this question back to the non-technical user so that they can understand the depth of this question. We came up with this illustration:

*I don’t know how to drive a car or where I am. Can you tell me in precise step by step instructions how to drive to the gas station that is nearest to you?*

With that context, it can perhaps become a bit more apparent why we can’t provide what you’re asking. It isn’t that we don’t want to, or that we’re not willing to. It’s that we don’t know where you’re going to get a car, we can’t tell you with perfect precision how to drive every car that exists without teaching you the theory of how to drive a car so that you can figure it out, and we can’t give you directions to a location when we have no idea where you are relative to where it is.

Configuring DNS is a lot like that. We can’t have a step by step tutorial for every DNS provider, though we’ll keep trying to build ones for the most common ones. Similarly, we can’t have a step by step tutorial for your domain because your configurations and needs are unique to your organization. You need to be able to understand what needs to be done, and how to interpret that in the context of what is true for you and your configurations. It is simply not physically possible for us to put ourselves in your shoes with no prior knowledge of your organization.

### Resources

We can absolutely help you get started though. Everything starts in the email we send you “Important Account Information” and goes from there. If you don’t see it, you missed the giant text we put on the page after your order that directed you to where to find a copy. If that is the case, please try to be more careful. If you’re not sure what you’re doing and you’re skipping out on the reading, you’re going to miss every method we’ve deployed to try to help you get where you need to be. For a reminder, that important email can be found here: [Emails - MXroute](https://accounts.mxroute.com/index.php?/clientarea/emails/)

If you didn’t read that email, you’re going to be lost. If you did, you shouldn’t be. Remember we have a whole wealth of documentation on our website that just might provide exactly what you need. https://mxroutedocs.com
