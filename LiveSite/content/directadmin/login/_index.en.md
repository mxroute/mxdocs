## Locate Information
When you sign up for MXroute and pay the invoice, an email will be sent to the address that you signed up with. The subject will be:

`[MXroute] Important Account Information`

If you don’t see that email, please go here to find it:  
[https://accounts.mxroute.com/index.php?/clientarea/emails/](https://accounts.mxroute.com/index.php?/clientarea/emails/)

Inside of this, you will find many things. One of the first will be the control panel information. Here is an example:
