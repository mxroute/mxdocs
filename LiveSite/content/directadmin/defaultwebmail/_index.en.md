Customers often ask us if they can change the default webmail client. On our current DirectAdmin-based systems there are no default email clients, you are welcome to use any that you like at any time. However, if you are using a custom webmail domain as instructed by [this tutorial](https://mxroutehelp.com/index.php/2019/08/25/custom-webmail-pop-imap-smtp-domain/), these point directly to Roundcube and that cannot be changed. However, consider that you can alternatively (or additionally) [use Crossbox on any URL that you choose.](https://mxroute.com/docs/branding-crossbox/)
