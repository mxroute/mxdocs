No and please go away. Our customers rely on us to do everything possible to help them get their emails into inboxes instead of spam folders. The very first line item that we’re expected to adhere to in order to accomplish this job is to keep email marketers off of our platform.

It’s become very apparent to us that a few people see this and think “Oh cool, we’ll be the only email marketers on their platform and we’ll just send a few, they won’t notice.” We will. You won’t. Where do you think our bad reviews come from?
